Tap/click on Take a Note... to get full Create Note section with "Title", "TexT Area" for content and "+" Button (with Zoom in animation).
Either of the fields (title or content) is necessary to create a note. Without both, "+" button won't work.

A bunch of notes. The notes cards are responsive. On mobile screen, each note will take full width of the screen and similarly for tablets, there will be less notes per row.
